## 🚨 Critical Issues Summary

### 🔴 BLOCKER Issues (Must fix to function)

1. **Android NFC/HCE not implemented** - Primary access method missing
2. **Firmware uses HTTP not HTTPS** - Security vulnerability (CVSS 9.8)
3. **Android has no API integration** - Cannot authenticate users
4. **Firmware wrong protocol** - Backend will reject requests

### 🔴 CRITICAL Issues (Must fix before production)

5. **Django CVEs** - SQL injection vulnerabilities
6. **Firmware hardcoded secrets** - WiFi credentials exposed
7. **Firmware infinite loops** - Devices can brick permanently
8. **No watchdog timer** - Firmware hangs forever on error
9. **Weak DB password** - Database compromise risk
10. **No token storage** - Android cannot persist auth

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### What Works ✅
- Backend is well-designed and mostly ready
- Clean code architecture (Django + DRF)
- Good security configuration (prod settings)
- Comprehensive test coverage (68%)

### What Needs Work ❌
- **Android:** Complete development needed (6-7 weeks)
- **Firmware:** Security and reliability rewrite (2 months)
- **Integration:** No end-to-end testing done
- **Documentation:** User guides needed

### Critical Path
```
Backend fixes (1 week) → Android dev (7 weeks) → Firmware dev (10 weeks)
                      ↓
                Integration testing (2 weeks) → Production
```

**Total:** 12 weeks (3 months) if done sequentially  
**Optimal:** 7-10 weeks if done in parallel (requires 3 developers)

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**Project Viability:** ✅ **VIABLE** with investment

**Conditions:**
1. Secure $35K budget for development
2. Hire experienced Android and Embedded developers
3. Commit to 3-month development timeline
4. Follow phased approach with Go/No-Go gates
5. Conduct security audit before production launch

**Alternative:**
If timeline or budget is critical, consider using existing access control platforms (Kisi, Brivo, Openpath) which provide:
- Proven reliability
- Professional support
- Faster deployment (weeks, not months)
- Lower total cost of ownership

**Decision Point:**
- **Build:** If custom requirements, IP ownership, or learning important
- **Buy:** If time-to-market, support, or proven tech is priority
